# vQoEe-Paltform
The Open Source user vQoEe platform aims to provide the research community with a simple,
efficient, comprehensive tool that complies with the community's recommendations for building subjective databases needed to 
estimate user experience. It consists of 2 parts: a hardware part composed of server, encoding device, display devices,
emotion sensor and a software part composed of various video encoding software, a network emulator as well as a man-machine 
interface necessary to conduct the tests. The goal is to be able to emulate a realistic test environment that is consistent
with Internet video viewing experiences. The databases collected contain a large number of related parameters/factors from users, 
application, network or display devices.
